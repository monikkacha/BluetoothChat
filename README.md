# BluetoothChat

I had plan to work with Bluetooth api and wanted to know that how can i transfer data between two endpoints using bluetooth . 
so i end up with creating Bluetooth chat app which can let you connect with nearby person with same app installed . 

The main motive was to understand Bluetooth Api and try to use this api for I.O.T. in future projects along with RaspberryPI and Ardunio .
